1.We need to Calculate the Shortest Path from Entry Point to Exit Point wherein The Entry Point is (0,0) and Exit Point is (N-1,M-1).

2.Here N,M defines the Dimensions of the Matrix(N,M).

3.Now We consider two approaches to Calculate the Shortest Path from Entry Point to Exit Point.

4.First Approach is Normal Recursive Approach,Other Approach is using Dynamic Programming(Memoization).

5.Dynamic Programming helps us to reduce the time by directly considering the solution for already solved SubProblems.
